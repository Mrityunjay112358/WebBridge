# WebBridge: AI-Powered Accessibility Assistant

**Making the web accessible for everyone, powered by AI.**

---

## üöÄ Inspiration & What It Does

The internet should be for everyone, but millions of users with disabilities still face barriers online. WebBridge was born from the desire to bridge this gap‚Äîleveraging AI to make the web more inclusive, usable, and friendly for all. 

**WebBridge** is a Chrome extension and backend analyzer that automatically detects, highlights, and fixes common accessibility issues on any website. It empowers users with visual, motor, cognitive, or language challenges to browse the web with greater ease and independence.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

WebBridge is composed of two main components:

- **Browser Extension (JavaScript/Chrome API):**
  - Injects a content script into web pages to analyze the DOM and apply accessibility enhancements in real time.
  - Uses Together AI for text simplification, translation, and image captioning.
  - Provides a user-friendly popup for toggling features and managing accessibility profiles.
- **Backend Analyzer (Python/Flask):**
  - Receives HTML from the extension, runs advanced accessibility checks (inspired by WCAG), and returns a detailed report of issues.
  - Enables deeper analysis than is possible client-side.

**Tech Stack:**
- JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS
- Chrome Extensions API
- Python (Flask)
- Together AI API

## ‚ö° Challenges We Ran Into

- **Cross-origin and browser security:** Handling permissions, CORS, and secure communication between extension, backend, and third-party APIs.
- **Accurate accessibility detection:** Ensuring reliable detection of issues like color contrast and missing alt text across diverse web designs.
- **AI integration:** Balancing meaningful, fast AI responses (for alt text, summaries, etc.) with smooth user experience, despite rate limits and latency.
- **Accessible UI/UX:** Designing overlays and controls that are themselves accessible and non-intrusive.

## üìù Setup & Development

1. **Clone the repository** and open in your editor.
2. **API Keys & Endpoints:**
   - Set your Together AI API key in `content.js` (`config.togetherApiKey`).
   - Ensure local endpoints (e.g., image captioning) are running if used.
3. **Load the extension:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder.
4. **Usage:**
   - Click the WebBridge icon in Chrome.
   - Set up your accessibility profile.
   - Toggle features as needed.
