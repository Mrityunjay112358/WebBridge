## How It Works

1. **Onboarding:**  
     On first install, users are prompted to set up their accessibility profile via a popup.

2. **Profile Management:**  
     Users can toggle accessibility features in the popup and save/reset their profile.

3. **Content Script:**  
     Features are injected into web pages based on the user's profile. AI services (Together AI, local image captioning) are used for advanced features.

4. **Communication:**  
     The popup, background, and content scripts communicate using Chrome's messaging APIs.

## Project Structure

- `background.js`  
    Handles extension lifecycle, tab updates, and messaging between popup and content scripts.

- `popup.html`  
    The extension's popup UI for managing the accessibility profile.

- `popup.js`  
    Logic for profile management, feature toggling, and UI feedback in the popup.

- `content.js`  
    Injected into web pages to apply accessibility features and interact with AI APIs.
